    <h1>About Brandon</h1>
  <P1>At a young age, I was a hyper wild child.  It was my aunt that realized, if you sat me down in front of a game, I was able to sit still, I was able to focus.  What pacified me as an energetic youth turned into a hobby I held dear.  I also had a natural nack for technology and gadgets.  It was around 5 or 6 when I heard my father admit he couldn’t figure out how to set the VCR clock, but that I could figure it out in minutes.  That was also around the age I became responsible for hooking everything up to the TV and VCR.</p1> <br>

    <p1>As I grew older that interest in video games led me to having a keen interest in science and technology.  Some people say their childhood was ruined when they learned the truth about holidays.  Mine was decimated when I came to understand that video games were not magical portals to other lands, they were man made works of technical achievement and art.</p1> <br>

<p1>Fast forward to high school, and even though I was too poor to afford a computer, I did have access to them at school and used them heavily.  My Senior year one of the English teachers approached me about how to create a power point presentation.  I cheerfully walked her through some of the cool things she could do in the program.  She was ecstatic and proud of her presentation for her meeting.  It felt good to help her, but to my surprise she insisted I accept money for helping her.  It was an odd concept for me to process at the time.</p1> <br>

<p1>Skipping to the next chapter I graduated college and entered the corporate rat race at Humana in their DSI department.  We worked hard, we played hard.  I came in as the young upstart and ended up running the department, then opening a new unique retail style service center, and then managing an enterprise fleet and their cloud print solution.</p1> <br>

<p1>The thing that I glossed over is just how good it feels to help someone.  I’m not being cheesy here.  When you do something that fixes the problem someone has had plaguing them sometime they’re grateful.  People can be demanding, but they can be appreciative too.   Along those lines it’s rewarding to teach someone a new skill, or show them an easier or faster way to perform a task.   I have and will always ascribe to the belief that if you empower your users, you increase their productivity and decrease their downtime.</p1> <br>

<p1>In non IT speak it means that you can show someone how to correct issues when they arise, and they will lose less time to those issue.  It’s the difference between fishing for someone vs teaching them to fish.  If you want to just do the thing I will.  However if you would like I will show you and walk you through what I do so you will be able to do it yourself.</p1>
